# Epic/Story
As a technical lead I want to have a "Member" service so that I can easily:
* Create a new member
* Read an existing member
* Update an existing member
* Delete members which are no longer used
* List existing members
* No frontend needed, only REST services are needed

# Acceptance Criteria
* RESTful Web Service with Spring/Spring Boot
* Member has the following attributes:
  * First name
  * Last name
  * Date of birth
  * Postal code (ZIP)
  * Picture (as File)
* Accepts JSON or XML
* Response in JSON or XML
* JDK8 or higher
* Build with Maven or Gradle
* Data storage: (in memory) database
* Documentation how to start and how to call the service

# HINT
## Keep in mind:
* Agile manifesto
* Clean code
* Software craftsmanship
